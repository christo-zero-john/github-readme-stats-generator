I am planning on developing a github profile readme generator webapp. Please conduct a project study on the webapp. It works like this:

1. Users could login to the web app.
2. Users click on create readme button.
3. Users select a template or start from scratch.
4. Users fill in the details.
5. Users preview the readme.
6. Users could download the readme as a markdown file, or copy as markdown text.


conduct a detailed project study on the project. Also include additional improvements if possible to the working I have presnetd. You may add new features to the working or remove non-important ones
